Front office developer at Morgan Stanley in London where I work on the repo trading platform for the client financing desk. I work on a wide variety of technologies mainly Spring based microservices and Angular frontends, but I regularly find myself working with C++ and C# to support our legacy tech stacks in addition to Python for automating common workloads.
