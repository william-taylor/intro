I‚Äôm a full stack Software Engineer based in London where I work in the financial services sector. My goto tools include Java and C++ but I'm comfortable working with a wide range of tools to get the job done! I‚Äôm a big fan of simplicity, clean code, automation, and low levels of technical debt. üòÉ
