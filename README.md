# Intro Site

An extremely basic static site to redirect people to my Github and Linkedin professional profiles if they search for me through a search engine. Went for a simple design to reflect that a detailed work summary and technology projects are best documented on Linkedin and Github respectively. No need to reinvent the wheel.

## Tech Stack

The site is deployed on Netlify for automatic deployments, HTTPS support, bundling and minimisation post processing out of the box. The site itself is built with Skeleton a tiny CSS library at under 400 lines of code with FontAwesome and Google Fonts providing fonts and icons like most modern sites.
